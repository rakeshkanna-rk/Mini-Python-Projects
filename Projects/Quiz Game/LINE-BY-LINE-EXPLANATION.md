Let's go through the code line by line and explain each part:

```python
def run_quiz():
```
- This line defines a function named `run_quiz()`, which serves as the main entry point for running the quiz game.

```python
    questions = [
        {
            "question": "What does CPU stand for?",
            "options": ["Central Processing Unit", "Computer Personal Unit", "Central Personal Unit", "None of the above"],
            "answer": "Central Processing Unit"
        },
        {
            "question": "Which programming language is known as the 'language of the web'?",
            "options": ["Python", "JavaScript", "Java", "C++"],
            "answer": "JavaScript"
        },
        # More questions are defined in a similar manner...
    ]
```
- This block of code initializes the `questions` list, which contains dictionaries representing each question in the quiz.
- Each dictionary has keys for the question text (`"question"`), answer options (`"options"`), and correct answer (`"answer"`).

```python
    score = 0
```
- This line initializes the `score` variable to keep track of the player's score. It starts at 0.

```python
    print("Welcome to the Tech Quiz!")
```
- This line prints a welcome message to the player when the quiz starts.

```python
    for i, q in enumerate(questions, 1):
```
- This line starts a loop that iterates over each question in the `questions` list.
- The `enumerate()` function is used to iterate over the list while also tracking the index (`i`) and the question dictionary (`q`). The index starts from 1.

```python
        print(f"\nQuestion {i}: {q['question']}")
```
- This line prints the question number (`i`) and the question text (`q['question']`) to the console.

```python
        for j, option in enumerate(q['options'], 1):
            print(f"{j}. {option}")
```
- This nested loop iterates over the answer options for the current question.
- It prints each option along with its corresponding number (`j`) to the console.

```python
        user_answer = input("Enter your choice (1-4): ")
```
- This line prompts the player to enter their choice (1-4) corresponding to the options presented for the current question.

```python
        if user_answer.isdigit() and 1 <= int(user_answer) <= 4:
```
- This line checks if the player's input is a digit between 1 and 4 using the `isdigit()` method and compares it using logical AND (`and`) with a range check.
- `isdigit()` checks if the input consists only of digits, and the range check ensures it is within the valid range.

```python
            if q['options'][int(user_answer) - 1] == q['answer']:
```
- This line checks if the player's answer matches the correct answer (`q['answer']`) for the current question.
- It indexes into the list of options (`q['options']`) to retrieve the selected option using the player's input.

```python
                print("Correct!")
                score += 1
```
- If the player's answer is correct, this line prints a "Correct!" message to the console and increments the player's score by 1.

```python
            else:
                print("Incorrect!")
                print(f"The correct answer is: {q['answer']}")
```
- If the player's answer is incorrect, this block of code prints an "Incorrect!" message to the console along with the correct answer for the question.

```python
        else:
            print("Invalid input! Skipping this question.")
```
- If the player's input is not a digit between 1 and 4, this line prints a message indicating that the input is invalid, and the question is skipped.

```python
    print(f"\nQuiz completed! Your final score is: {score}/{len(questions)}")
```
- After all questions have been answered, this line prints a message indicating that the quiz is completed along with the player's final score out of the total number of questions.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_quiz()
```
- This block of code ensures that the `run_quiz()` function is executed when the script is run as the main program.
- It allows the quiz game to be run directly from the command line or imported as a module into another Python script without executing the quiz automatically.
