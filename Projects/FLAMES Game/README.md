# FLAMES Checker

FLAMES Checker is a simple Python script to determine the relationship status between two people based on the FLAMES game.

## How it works

FLAMES is a popular game that predicts the relationship between two individuals. It works by removing common letters from their names, then cycling through the acronym FLAMES (Friends, Lovers, Attraction, Marriage, Enemies, Siblings) until only one letter remains, which corresponds to the relationship status.

This script takes two names as input, removes common letters, and iterates through the FLAMES acronym until a relationship status is determined.

## To play the FLAMES game traditionally:

1. **Write down the names**: Start by writing down the full names of the two individuals (usually yourself and your crush or partner) on a piece of paper.
   
2. **Remove common letters**: Cross out all the common letters shared between the two names. For example, if both names have the letter "A", cross out both occurrences.

3. **Count the remaining letters**: Count the total number of remaining letters after removing the common ones.

4. **FLAMES acronym**: Write down the word "FLAMES" vertically on another piece of paper or in your mind.

5. **Eliminate letters**: Starting from the letter "F", count through the letters of the FLAMES acronym, eliminating each letter according to the count of remaining letters from step 3. For example, if there are 5 remaining letters, eliminate every 5th letter from the list.

6. **Repeat until one letter remains**: Continue eliminating letters in a loop until only one letter remains in the FLAMES acronym.

7. **Determine the relationship**: The remaining letter corresponds to a particular relationship category:
   - F: Friends
   - L: Lovers
   - A: Attraction
   - M: Marriage
   - E: Enemies
   - S: Siblings

8. **Interpret the result**: Depending on the letter that remains, interpret the relationship status between the two individuals based on the corresponding category.

Note: While the FLAMES game is often played for fun, it's important to remember that it's just a game and not an accurate predictor of real-life relationships.
